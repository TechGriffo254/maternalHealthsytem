# --- Maternal Health Appointment and Alert System (MHAAS) ---

## Project Overview

The Maternal Health Appointment and Alert System (MHAAS) is a web-based application designed to support rural clinics in Kenya by improving the management of maternal health appointments, sending automated reminders, and providing essential health tips to expectant mothers. This system aims to address challenges such as missed antenatal visits, late deliveries, and reliance on outdated paper records.

## Features

The system supports multiple user roles, each with specific responsibilities:

* **üõ°Ô∏è Super Admin:**
    * Onboard new hospitals into the system.
    * Add a dedicated Hospital Admin for each onboarded hospital.
    * View activity logs across the entire system.
    * View all users registered in the system (Super Admins, Hospital Admins, Staff, Patients).

* **üè• Hospital Admin:**
    * Manage and onboard staff members (doctors, nurses) for their specific hospital.
    * View and manage patient records associated with their hospital.
    * Oversee and manage all appointments and reminders within their hospital.

* **üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Staff (Doctors/Nurses):**
    * Register new patients into the system.
    * Create and manage visits for individual patients.
    * Set and update appointment schedules for patients.
    * Send timely reminders to patients regarding appointments or health tips.

* **ü§∞ Patient:**
    * View their personal appointment schedules and visit history.
    * Submit health records (e.g., audio notes, text updates) to their assigned staff.
    * Receive automated reminders for appointments and health-related alerts.
    * Access and read basic maternal health tips relevant to their pregnancy stage.
